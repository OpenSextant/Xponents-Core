  <h2> Xponents Data Model</h2>
    The key constructs here are the GeoBase and Geocoding.&nbsp; GeoBase
    provides a base class for anything that has an ID, name or label,
    and a coordinate.&nbsp; Geocoding provides an interface for any
    heuristic that helps ground some data to a coordinate, while
    providing additional metadata about the geocoding itself.&nbsp; For
    example, beyond an actual coordinate useful geocoding attributes
    include:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>precision and confidence</li>
      <li>country code and province code or name</li>
      <li>method or source for geocoding, e.g., derivation or rote
        lookup<br>
      </li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Country and Place objects are extensions of GeoBase. Country is
      used extensively in place name extraction, reverse geocoding, and
      general country name/code lookups.&nbsp; See GeonamesUtility for
      more country metadata tools.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Language object helps tie language code and name. 
    LangDetect and LangId (<code>org.opensextant.extractors.langid</code>)
    provide some tools for language detection.  Language ID does not always line 
    up with a known Language code literally, as LangID may yield language + locale.
    So there is a need to be able to parse and manage explicit and inferred language/locale codings.
    
    </p>
    <p>
    Java SDK Locale classes appear to only cover those used for computer internationalization.
    ICU4J libraries, for example, do not have a simple clear API.  
    So, I created language lookup tables around ISO-639 codes (sourced from <a href="http://loc.gov">Library of Congress</a>)
    which are found in <code>org.opensextant.util.TextUtility</code>:   getLanguage(), getLanguageCode(), getLanguageMap().

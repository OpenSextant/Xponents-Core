    <h2>Patterns Of Life (PoLi)</h2>
    <p>Patterns are all around us. <br>
    </p>
    <p> We expanded the use cases of geographic coordinates and
      date/time patterns into other common patterns that occur in daily
      life and business: telephone numbers, URLs, money/currency, cyber
      addresses, etc.&nbsp; These work best when you are trying to make
      all of your entity extraction look similar to the standard
      Xponents approach rendering things down to <code>TextMatch</code>
      annotation objects<br>
    </p>
    <p>Since pattern development is required here, we strongly suggest
      you start by looking at the tester TestPoLi, which has a main
      program.<br>
    </p>
    <p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ant -f ./script/testing.xml&nbsp;
        test-poli&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;args&gt;<br>
      </code></p>
    <code></code>Available patterns in this toolkit are listed at <a
href="https://github.com/OpenSextant/Xponents/blob/master/src/main/resources/poli_patterns.cfg">src/main/resources/poli_patterns.cfg</a><br>
    <br>
    You develop a pattern, a test case for it, and then iteratively
    refine as you test -- using the the TestPoLi tool to test if your
    patterns are working. <br>

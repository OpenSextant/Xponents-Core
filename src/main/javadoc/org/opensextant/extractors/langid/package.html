    <h2> Language Detection </h2>
    Xponents LangDetect class here wraps <a
      href="https://github.com/Norconex/language-detection">Cybozu
      LangDetect </a>(Maven: <a
href="http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Ccom.norconex.language%7Clangdetect%7C1.3.0%7Cjar">http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Ccom.norconex.language%7Clangdetect%7C1.3.0%7Cjar</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It is a decent library but required a number of additions to make it
    a bit more usable:<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>LangDetect.detect() returns list of unordered
        probabilities.&nbsp; Xponents simplifies this so caller can get
        ordered list with highest probability first, and then also a
        simple method to return just a language object (code +name) </li>
      <li>Profiles are accessible only from File system, not via
        resource path/stream.&nbsp; Profiles for LangDetect are unpacked
        on file system prior to usage -- Xponents packages these for
        runtime use.</li>
      <li>In situations where very little natural language is present in
        the text, CyboZu may fail. Xponents provides a variety of fall
        backs to get at the most common language detection
        possibilities.</li>
      <li>Overall, Xponents LangDetect provides a simplified approach to
        language detection, while still providing full access to the
        underlying CyboZu library as needed.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

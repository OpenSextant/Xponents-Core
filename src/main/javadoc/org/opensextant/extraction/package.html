    <h2> Extraction Fundamentals
    </h2>
    <p>Extraction fundamentals include <code>TextEntity</code>, a span in free text, and <code>TextMatch</code> a
    TextEntity generated by an extractor, matcher, or rule.  A span is defined as a character start offset 
    and end offset.  A TextEntity provides basic reasoning for span logic and math:  compare spans before, after
    within, overlap, etc.
    
    <p>Beyond that, the extraction helpers here provide specific Solr tagger support, match filteration,
    match navigation, and match metrics.
